My first project ever so give me a break

This program is for FOX HUNTING or RDF in Amateur Radio
With the Arduino, Optocoupler, and a Transceiver, You will be able to active the PTT of a HT, send 
morse code through the speaker/microphone input, de-activate the PTT and repeat. 

Could be also used as a Beacon  


Please explain any changes as I am new to the learning process of programmnig.

Thanks - NT1K
